Convolutional neural network is a type of neural networks which are used in image recognition and classification of data. In Conv1D, the kernel slides along one dimension. Basically, time series data or sensory data are used for this method as kernel can move in one dimension along axis of time.Here, median housing value is predicted longitude, latitude, housing median age, total number of rooms, total number of bedrooms, population, number of households, and median income attributes of the California housing dataset. The method used for the prediction of house median value is Conv1D neural networks. Finally, we are evaluating the model on testing dataset to check how it performance using MSE and R2 score. The L1 loss score and R2 score for this model is 62634.1 and 0.43 respectively.
